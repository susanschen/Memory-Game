# MEMORY GAME PROJECT

## How to Play
1. Click on any card to reveal a symbol.
2. Click on another card to find the matching symbol.
3. Use your memory to remember what symbol shows up on which card.
4. You win the game when all 16 cards are matched!

Tips: The time to win the game does not affect the star rating. After eight cards are revealed, you have four tries to find a match before the star rating drops by one. You can still win game with a zero star rating.

## STUDENT PROJECT
This interactive JavaScript-based game is my completed student project that fulfilled all the project specifications.  The starter code from [Udacity's repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) provided a JavaScript file that includes a shuffle function (to shuffle a deck of cards) to help the student. All other code are to be completed by the student.

### PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS 

| CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS 
|---|:---
| Memory Game Logic | The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
| Congratulations Popup | When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
| Restart Button | A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
| Star Rating | The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a 1 star rating. The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point.
| Timer | When the player starts a game, a timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
| Move Counter | Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.

### EXTRA FEATURES
- Add CSS animations when cards are clicked and successfully matched.
